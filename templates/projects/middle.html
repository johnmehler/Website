        <a href="https://reisman.org/jmehler/rss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RSS Reader</a>
    </h3>    
    <p>This is an RSS feed reader. It lists articles from sources I find interesting in chronological order. This is my first foray into using Docker.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Creating the Site:</strong> Flask, HTML, CSS, JSON</li>
        <li><strong>Hosting the Site:</strong> Baremetal, Docker, Kubernetes, Github</li>
        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> $0. Hosted for free on Azure.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> I wanted to build a newsfeed that wouldn't drive me insane, and I was halfway done building it before I discovered Inoreader.</li>
    </ul>
